# Stadus_Scoreboard
A lot of people were really interested in our Scoreboard and since I thought about shutting down my community. I want to give back something to the FiveM community!

### Installation
1. Replace your scoreboard by going into [system] and simply replace the content of `scoreboard` with this script. This is important! You cannot add this as an seperate resource as the script will break, as the script will end up [looking like this](https://i.imgur.com/4KzuLyf.jpg)
2. Put `scoreboard` somewhere after `es_extended` in your server configuration file

### How do I customize the logo?
Go in to scoreboard/html and replace newlogo.png with your own.

### Credits
Thanks to the FiveM-team for the initial version of the scoreboard. I would really appreciate if you would leave the watermark "made by Stadus".

### Notes
I won't help with any support whatsoever.
